### About the project

This is a shooting game made by Frankie Bagnardi (age 17 at time of writing) and T.J. Bagnardi (age 6 at time of writing).  

Most of the game artwork is done by T.J.  The source code is written by Frankie.

### How can I help?

If you have any suggestions they would be much appreciated.  I (Frankie) am fairly new to C# and XNA so I could use any advice you have.  I'm sure I made something harder than it had to be.
